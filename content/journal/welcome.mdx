After years of filling my phone with countless photos of Komako, I finally decided to create a proper home for all these memories. This gallery is more than just a collection of cute cat photos (though there are plenty of those!) - it's a chronicle of daily life with a Scottish Fold who has completely stolen our hearts.

## Why a gallery?

Every cat parent knows the struggle: thousands of photos scattered across devices, the best moments buried in camera rolls, and no easy way to share the joy our furry friends bring us. This gallery solves all of that while creating something beautiful to look back on.

## What to expect

I'll be regularly updating this space with:

- **Daily moments**: Those perfect captures of Komako being herself
- **Themed albums**: Collections organized by seasons, moods, and activities  
- **Stories**: The context behind the photos, her quirks, and the adventures we share
- **Milestones**: Celebrating birthdays, gotcha days, and other special moments

## About Komako

Born on March 26, 2021, Komako is a Scottish Fold with the sweetest temperament. Her folded ears give her that distinctive owl-like appearance, but it's her personality that truly shines. Patient, playful, and endlessly curious about the world around her.

Living in Brisbane means she enjoys year-round sunshine (through windows, of course - she's strictly an indoor cat), and you'll often find her in various sunny spots throughout our home.

## Technical details

For those interested, this gallery is built with modern web technologies to ensure fast loading times and a beautiful viewing experience on any device. Every image is optimized for quick loading while maintaining quality, and the site works perfectly whether you're browsing on your phone or desktop.

Thank you for visiting Komako's corner of the internet. I hope these photos bring you as much joy as she brings us every single day!
