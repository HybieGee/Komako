          <h2>Meet Komako</h2>
          <p>
            Born on March 26, 2021, Komako is a Scottish Fold cat who has been bringing joy and 
            companionship to our home in Brisbane, Australia. With her distinctive folded ears 
            and round, expressive eyes, she captures hearts wherever she goes.

          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>
            Komako is the perfect blend of playful and peaceful. She loves interactive play sessions 
            but is equally content lounging in sunny spots throughout the house. Her gentle nature 
            makes her an ideal companion, always ready with a soft purr and a head bump.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Incredibly affectionate and loves cuddles</li>
            <li>Curious about everything, especially new boxes</li>
            <li>Patient and gentle, never uses her claws</li>
            <li>Vocal when it's dinner time (very persuasive!)</li>

          <p>
